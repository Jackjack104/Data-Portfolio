In the fast-evolving digital marketplace, understanding how specific website features influence sales and customer behavior is crucial for businesses striving to optimize their online presence. The "Website Feature Sales Impact Analysis" leverages advanced Python programming to dissect the effects of a newly introduced website feature on sales performance. This analysis provides a deep dive into the feature's impact, employing a data-driven approach to scrutinize changes in key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with sales metrics.

## Objectives

 The core aim of this analysis is to elucidate the relationship between the implementation of a specific website feature and its subsequent influence on sales. By examining a comprehensive dataset spanning twelve months ( six months before and after) the feature's launchâ€”we seek to:
* Quantify the feature's impact on monthly sales revenue and its month-to-month percent change, highlighting immediate and short-term effects.
* Analyze shifts in average revenue per customer, offering insights into variations in customer value post-feature implementation.
* Investigate changes in the Average Order Value (AOV), to understand alterations in purchasing behavior attributable to the new feature.
