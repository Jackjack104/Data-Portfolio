Cohort Retention Analysis - 2024

## Executive Summary

Cohort Analysis is a method of behavioral analytics that groups users, customers, or subjects into cohorts based on shared characteristics over a specific time period. This approach helps organizations track these cohorts and compare how they behave over time, rather than looking at all users as a single unit. For this analysis we will be using the customer's first sale month as the cohort characteristic. 

## Goal Statement
The primary goal of this cohort analysis is to examine the retention rates of new customers acquired each month. By analyzing the engagement and ongoing patronage we aim to assess and understand the dynamics of customer loyalty and retention.This insight is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of our customer acquisition and retention strategies and will help guide improvements in these areas. 

## Key Findings

* The analysis of user retention cohorts over several years has highlighted a significant pattern of diminishing engagement over time. Retention is at its apex immediately after the initial purchase, waning thereafter, which underscores a pivotal period for nurturing sustainable customer relationships. Despite the general downward trend, sporadic surges or periods of stable retention signal the influence of external pressures or successful internal initiatives, meriting deeper examination.
  
* Seasonal trends also play a noticeable role, with some start months exhibiting a consistent pattern of higher initial retention, suggesting the presence of temporal factors affecting user retention. These findings stress the importance of strategic engagement efforts aimed at preserving user activity, including custom loyalty programs and regular, pertinent communication.
  
* The detected 'honeymoon' phase within customer lifecycles presents an opportunity to investigate what factors could extend the duration of active user engagement. Moreover, the persistence of a fraction of users in engaging over the long haul identifies a key demographic crucial for understanding and duplicating retention triumphs. Leveraging these insights, businesses can fine-tune their strategies to not only retain users more effectively but also to convert newcomers into devoted, lasting customers.
